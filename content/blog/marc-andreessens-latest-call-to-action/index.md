Marc Andreessen dropped a savage call to action for all builders and entrepreneurs. In a recently published essay he emphatically declares that [It's Time to Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/).

The essay is well worth the read. The central thesis is that America has fallen behind in a large number of areas, from education to infrastructure to healthcare. He brings it home that America needs to start building great things again. 

We have the technology. Now we just need massive action and bold ideas in order to bring a new Gilded Age to America. The future awaits. Let's build.
